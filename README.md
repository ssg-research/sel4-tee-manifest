# seL4 CAmkES TEE manifest

This repository contains the project manifest for the trusted execution
environment (TEE) proof-of-concept implementation for the project researching
integrity protection of remote attestation procedures in the case of
confidentiality compromise of the TEE.
The manifest is necessary to initialize and configure the project using `repo`.
It specifies all dependencies and where to place them in the project folder.

See the `sel4-tee` repo that contains the TEE implementation
([GitHub](https://github.com/ssg-research/sel4-tee)) to get started.
